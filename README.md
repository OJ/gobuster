## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Install gobuster
go install github.com/OJ/gobuster/v3@latest

# Basic directory enumeration
gobuster dir -u https://example.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt

# DNS subdomain enumeration
gobuster dns -do example.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt

# Virtual host discovery
gobuster vhost -u https://example.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt

# S3 bucket enumeration
gobuster s3 -w /path/to/bucket-names.txt
```

## üì¶ Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

```bash
go install github.com/OJ/gobuster/v3@latest
```

**Requirements**: Go 1.24 or higher

### Alternative Installation Methods

#### Using Binary Releases

Download pre-compiled binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster/releases).

#### Using Docker

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull ghcr.io/oj/gobuster:latest

# Run gobuster in Docker
docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/oj/gobuster:latest dir -u https://example.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
```

#### Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OJ/gobuster.git
cd gobuster
go mod tidy
go build
```

### Troubleshooting Installation

If you encounter issues:

- Ensure Go version 1.24+ is installed: `go version`
- Check your `$GOPATH` and `$GOBIN` environment variables
- Verify `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `$PATH`

## üéØ Usage

Gobuster uses a mode-based approach. Each mode is designed for specific enumeration tasks:

```bash
gobuster [mode] [options]
```

### Getting Help

```bash
gobuster help                   # Show general help
gobuster help [mode]            # Show help for specific mode
gobuster [mode] --help          # Alternative help syntax
```

### üìä Available Modes

#### üåê Directory Mode (`dir`)

Enumerate directories and files on web servers.

**Basic Usage:**

```bash
gobuster dir -u https://example.com -w wordlist.txt
```

**Advanced Options:**

```bash
# With file extensions
gobuster dir -u https://example.com -w wordlist.txt -x php,html,js,txt

# With custom headers and cookies
gobuster dir -u https://example.com -w wordlist.txt -H "Authorization: Bearer token" -c "session=value"

# Show response length
gobuster dir -u https://example.com -w wordlist.txt -l

# Filter by status codes
gobuster dir -u https://example.com -w wordlist.txt -s 200,301,302

# Filter using a regex against the response body
# This can be handy for websites that return status code 200 for everything, but the html contains an error message
# NOTE: we need to exclude status codes `200` for this to work
gobuster dir -u https://example.com -w wordlist.txt -b 200 -re "error\shello"

# Filter using a regex but inverted against the response body
gobuster dir -u https://example.com -w wordlist.txt -b 200 -rei "(?i)\berror\b"
```

#### üîç DNS Mode (`dns`)

Discover subdomains through DNS resolution.

**Basic Usage:**

```bash
gobuster dns -do example.com -w wordlist.txt
```

**Advanced Options:**

```bash
# Use custom DNS server
gobuster dns -do example.com -w wordlist.txt -r 8.8.8.8:53

# Increase threads for faster scanning
gobuster dns -do example.com -w wordlist.txt -t 50
```

#### üè† Virtual Host Mode (`vhost`)

Discover virtual hosts on web servers.

**Basic Usage:**

```bash
gobuster vhost -u https://example.com --append-domain -w wordlist.txt
```

#### ‚òÅÔ∏è S3 Mode (`s3`)

Enumerate Amazon S3 buckets.

**Basic Usage:**

```bash
gobuster s3 -w bucket-names.txt
```

**With Debug Output:**

```bash
gobuster s3 -w bucket-names.txt --debug
```

#### üñ•Ô∏è TFTP Mode (`tftp`)

Enumerate files on tftp servers.

**Basic Usage:**

```bash
gobuster tftp -s 10.0.0.1 -w wordlist.txt
```

#### ‚òÅÔ∏è GCS Mode (`gcs`)

Enumerate Google Cloud Storage Buckets.

**Basic Usage:**

```bash
gobuster gcs -w bucket-names.txt
```

**With Debug Output:**

```bash
gobuster gcs -w bucket-names.txt --debug
```

#### üîß Fuzz Mode (`fuzz`)

Custom fuzzing with the `FUZZ` keyword.

**Basic Usage:**

```bash
gobuster fuzz -u https://example.com?FUZZ=test -w wordlist.txt
```

**Advanced Examples:**

```bash
# Fuzz URL parameters
gobuster fuzz -u https://example.com?param=FUZZ -w wordlist.txt

# Fuzz headers
gobuster fuzz -u https://example.com -H "X-Custom-Header: FUZZ" -w wordlist.txt

# Fuzz POST data
gobuster fuzz -u https://example.com -d "username=admin&password=FUZZ" -w passwords.txt
```

## üí° Common Use Cases

### Web Application Security Testing

```bash
# Comprehensive directory enumeration
gobuster dir -u https://target.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php,html,js,txt,asp,aspx,jsp

# API endpoint discovery
gobuster dir -u https://api.target.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -x json

# Admin panel discovery
gobuster dir -u https://target.com -w admin-panels.txt -s 200,301,302,403
```

### DNS Reconnaissance

```bash
# Comprehensive subdomain enumeration
gobuster dns -do target.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/dnsrecon/subdomains-top1mil-5000.txt -t 50
```

### Cloud Storage Assessment

```bash
# S3 bucket enumeration with patterns
gobuster s3 -w company-names.txt -v

# GCS bucket enumeration
gobuster gcs -w company-names.txt -v
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Permission Denied" or "Access Denied"

- Try reducing thread count with `-t` flag
- Add delays between requests with `--delay`
- Use different user agent with `-a` flag

#### "Connection Timeout"

- Increase timeout with `--timeout` flag
- Reduce thread count for slower targets
- Check your internet connection

#### "No Results Found"

- Verify the target URL is accessible
- Try different wordlists
- Check status code filtering with `-s` flag

### Performance Issues

#### Slow Scanning

- Increase thread count with `-t` flag (but be careful not to overwhelm the target)
- Use smaller, more targeted wordlists

## üéØ Best Practices

### Security Testing Guidelines

1. **Always get proper authorization** before testing any target
2. **Start with low thread counts** to avoid overwhelming servers
3. **Use appropriate wordlists** for the target technology
4. **Respect rate limits** and implement delays if needed
5. **Monitor your network traffic** to avoid detection

### Wordlist Selection

- **For web applications**: Use technology-specific wordlists (PHP, ASP.NET, etc.)
- **For APIs**: Focus on common API endpoints and versioning patterns
- **For DNS**: Use subdomain-specific wordlists with common patterns
- **For cloud storage**: Use company/brand-specific patterns

### Output Management

```bash
# Save results to file
gobuster dir -u https://example.com -w wordlist.txt -o results.txt

# Use quiet mode for clean output
gobuster dir -u https://example.com -w wordlist.txt -q
```
