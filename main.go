// Gobuster -- by OJ Reeves
//
// A crap attempt at building something that resembles
// dirbuster or dirb using Go. The goal was to build
// a tool that would help learn Go and to actually do
// something useful. The idea of having this compile
// to native code is also appealing.
//
// Run: gobuster -h
